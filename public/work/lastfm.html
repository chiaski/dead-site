                    <h2 id="part-context">Context</h2>
                    <h1>The music platform for diehards</h1>
                    <p>The beauty of Last.fm is that it puts discovery, community, and data together. Last.fm was founded in 2002&mdash;I created my profile in 2011, when I was 10, but didn't really use it aside from recording a single scrobble of Lady Gaga's Love Game.</p>

                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img loading="lazy" class="image-full" src="../assets/portfolio/lastfm/flavor-ladygaga.jpg" style="border-radius: 50px;padding: 1em;">
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>I started listening to music seriously the summer before college. Ordering vinyl, albums front-to-back, delving into music criticism. I joined my college radio station, filled up my music catalogue with carefully-collected YouTube-only finds and Bandcamp exclusives. In 2019, Spotify Wrapped told me I listened for 140,000 minutes.</p>
                    
                    <p>After looking at hundreds of music charts, I rediscovered Last.fm: a site that syncs with music platforms and collects your listening activity in one space. It delivers listening reports, recommendations, and lets you chat over artists, albums, and music and follow other people's activity.
                    As a music fan, I fell in love with the product: it understands me like no other. My activity, meeting new friends over mmusic, and giving me the best recommendations of any platform.</p>

            <p class='center-emphasis'>
                <strong>In the age of streaming, Last.fm unifies music&mdash;making the product more relevant than ever</strong>
            </p>

                    <p>Here's the thing: Last.fm brands itself as your <strong>"musical calling card."</strong> However, the mobile application doesn't reflect this yet. I set out to design a mobile experience for Last.fm: <strong>the go-to place for music from everywhere should be accessible anywhere.</strong></p>



                    <h3>Last.fm on mobile today</h3>


                    <p><strong>At present</strong>, the Last.fm mobile app shows you your aggregated music ("scrobble") history and some stats. Let's see what's missing. </p>
                    
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img loading="lazy" class="image-full" src="../assets/portfolio/lastfm/lastfm-present.png">
                        <em>Present Last.fm mobile app</em>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Rationale</h3>

                    <p>Streaming is <em>so disjointed</em> nowadays. I'm switching between Spotify, YouTube, my local files, Bandcamp, and more. Worse: It's hard for people to really get data to track things even if it's supposedly feeding into everything. But people love data. Spotify Wrapped is lauded as a genius marketing campaign. People still flex their music on their Instagram story (don't worry, I listen). People check <a href="http://107.170.81.187" target="_blank">random sites off IPs</a> just to see their top artists.<br><br>This is where Last.fm fits in well. I'll be a forever advocate of how it's an underrated product that could boost itself up with a much-needed update.</p>

                    <h2>Understanding Last.fm users</h2>
                    <p>Collected from online comments and personal interviews, reaching out to people through a call, face-to-face, or in text.</p>

                        <div class="testimonial">
                            Legit go out of my way to make sure everything I listen to is scrobbled. Having 90% of my music listening history going all the way back to 2006 is rad.
                        </div>
                        <div class="testimonial">
                            I still use it for <strong>tracking what I listen to</strong>, but I haven't used it for listening to music in ages.
                        </div>
                        <div class="testimonial">
                            For me Last.Fm serves a different purpose of tracking how much music I've listened to. Where something like RYM is more of creating a catalogue of what I though about albums as well as discovering.
                        </div>
                        <div class="testimonial">
                            I just use Last.Fm just to track how many times I've listened to something, <strong>I really love stats</strong> (maybe because i'm a sports fan) but ill listen to Spotify and use Last.FM to track what i hear on there.
                        </div>
                        <div class="testimonial">
                            I actually recently got Last.fm because I really like seeing the statistics of what I listen to. Also, <strong>if anybody asks me what music I like, I can just show them my Last.fm profile.</strong> I do enjoy showing my tastes off to other people. I don’t really know of anything else that can track my listening habits from all platforms better than this.
                        </div>
                        <div class="testimonial">
                            Last.fm has always been about the stats for me and it still provides that. Probably way, way more efficiently than the old site did, actually, since it is now incredibly easy to look at, for any time interval you want, most-played artists or songs or albums, or songs by artist/by album, or jump to a certain date, or to a certain month, or compare play counts for months, or track which years/months you most listened to a certain artist... etc etc.
                        </div>

                    </div>
                    <p>Last.fm is populated by <strong>diehard music fans</strong>. These are people who want too understand their music activity closely, people who love statistics&mdash;these are people who enjoy seeing their music date back <em>years</em>, and socializing with people who do the same.</p>

                    <p>With these comments, I thought exploring a design that focused on bettering stat and history features&mdash;a key part of Last.fm's enjoyability today.</p>

                            <p>The beauty of stats and related artists are missing, when the data is all there!</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>


                    <p>I talked to existing Last.fm users and explored Last.fm alternatives to explore issues with the current mobile experience. What fI found <strong>aligned with my personal experiences: the Last.fm app is underwhelming,</strong> it displays the raw data, but doesn't <em>synthesize it.</em></p>


                    <p class="emphasis">How might we give on-the-go listeners the ability to understand and discover their music?</p>


                    <p>What does Last.fm serve when it tracks music you're playing on your phone, without letting you dive into that history? Tracking and listening history would become a priority.</p>

                    <hr>

                    <h3>New Architecture & Map</h3>

                    <p>For this iteration of the redesign, I prioritized building an onboarding flow, showcasing listening history and statistics, reworking the way music information is presented, and introducing the social aspects of the site on mobile through profiles. </p>

                    <div class="image-container">

                        <img loading="lazy" class="image-full" src="../assets/portfolio/lastfm/flow.jpg">

                        <em>Mapping for a proposed redesign, first prioritizing the addition of stats, discovery, and minimal social features (profiles)</em>
                    </div>
                    <br>

                    <p>Intuitive <a href="https://darkblueheaven.com/spatialsoftware/" target="_blank">spacial interfaces</a> like Snapchat's are a huge inspiration in the mapping of this. Discovery should very much feel under the user's fingertips: which I want to intentionally imitate with the interaction design of the app. The user should be able to jump from artist to artist if a relation is present, and navigate their data in a sensible way.</p>

                    <p>In these designs, you'll notice a heavy use of images. One impactful feature on Last.fm is <strong>community-voted images</strong> that overlay music pages. It's memorable and beautiful: I wanted to keep this level of customization and intimacy in.</p>

I didn't want this redesign to be overwhelming with features, which is one of the downfalls of its web version (too many dead/underused features). I was careful to preserve common interactions after mapping out the app architecture.</p>

                    <h1>A redesigned musicscape</h1>

                    <p>Last.fm is an incredible product that has the potential to expand its existing demographic and userbase (largely diehard music fans, extensive listeners) into the masses. By pushing on screens and nudging the user towards discovery, there's a ton of potential to revive it with a redesign. Here, I focus on an exploration that touches on these main screen forms.</p>
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    <p><strong>KPIs for this Redesign</strong>&mdash;Usage of discovery and informational screens: Search, viewing details on music, and the recommendation features.<br> I would cut track/album/artist pages if they weren't being used, and focus more on dataa.</p>

                    <p><strong>Social Compatibility</strong>&mdash;How do profiles come into play on the app? By taking a music-centric approach, user profiles can showcase music compatibility, and lead users to trails of new artists from other's own habits. It's social without being explicit about traditional, cluttered messaging and chat features that are better suited to the full website.<br>At the bottom of music pages, "Top Listeners" highlighted by recent activity can be displayed to further facilitate this.</p>

                    <h2 id="part-results">Next Steps</h2>

                    <p>As a product, Last.fm has a dwindling userbase and desperately needs to be the best at its many developed features over the years. To me and in this redesign, that was how in an age of mobile streaming over dozens of services: it <strong>connects and makes sense of everything</strong>, empowering me as a listener by letting me know the data behind my behavior.</p>

                    <p>Instead of falling into a trap of underused prompts or spaces, I'm interested in seeing how the dead simple edge as a <em>musical calling card</em> can lead to everything else: discovery, engagement, and more streams. I'm certain there's power in these building blocks even if the mobile redesign doesn't have the entire web featureset: there's already so much we can get from these numbers and materials. They're simply universal to every listener.</p>


                    <ul class="feature-large">
                        <li><strong>Going social ❔ </strong><br>
                            This design only featured user profiles as a beginning engagement space. If put into action, it would be interesting to observe data on how users engage with one another&mdash;especially while only currently prompted by music pages.</li>

                        <li><strong>Listening activity ❔ </strong><br>With the redesign, it would be interesting to capture how much more active listeners are. Are they only checking on Last.fm to see their latest activity? Do their behaviors change now that there's more numbers and customization that reflect their listens?</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>Again, all of this is still a work-in-progress. Let me know what you think, or better yet&mdash;let me know how you listen. </p>
