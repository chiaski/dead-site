                    <h1>Technology that bridges, not divides</h1>
                    <p>Developh exists in the interesting tech space of the Philippines: driven by hope and spiked interest, but with lack of infrastructure for students or involvement of <em>Filipinos</em> in many large companies. Our lives are undeniably intertwined in the consumption of technology, not really the creation of it.</p>
                    
                    <p>From our start as a casual development organization in a high school in the Philippines to our evolution as a remote   international nonprofit servicing tens of thousands of students across our programming, here are some of our workings and learnings across design. Currently, we have a 7-person design team (including me) producing initiatives and materials for over 4 chapters, 50+ student communities, and tens of thousands of students.<br>For nearly four years have we been working at breaking apart and reinventing tech's systems at Developh, and communicating these efforts and building on it. Here's a snippet of what we do.</p>
                    <br>

        <h3>Logos</h3>
        <p>In 2016, we began as a casual game development and technology organization known as <strong>Developers' Society</strong>, off a video game motif. A year later, we rebranded to a somewhat generic circuit icon to reflect our expansion as a general tech organization with a fascination for startups. In 2018, we changed our name to <strong>Developh</strong>&mdash;accompanying our expanded goals across innovation, startups, and technology. the new logo is adapted from the connectivity symbol.</p>

            <h3>Pitchdecks</h3>
            <p>Over the years, we've gone from casually introducing our organization to member aspirants to being crowded into Manila skyrises to get a chance at an event partnership or some funding. As we grew, I designed our decks focused more on highlighting entrypoints for potential stakeholders (students, companies), weaving our narrative and thesis as an organization into numbers, and always highlighting the work we've done. Good practice I always like to do is extra slides at the end to flip to if needed for any complex, anticipated questions.</p>

                <h3>Recruitment Cycle</h3>
                <p>Until 2019, we conducted recruitment cycles: three-week periods of intense marketing and campaigning to gather users on a limited-time signup form. We would onboard them through a series of tasks (posting on the group, sharing a DevEd material, or signing up for a mentor/activity) and have them on our group and mailing list loop.</p>

                <p>Recruitment cycles were too isolating in reach; we noticed students finding us through yearly programming and inquiring to join&mdash;who we couldn't make wait another 8 or so months to onboard.</p>
                <p>Our new community system with Developh establishes a consistent entrypoint (the group/member mailing list) whenever we run projects, gives us new funnels through existing tech groups in high schools and universities, and allows us to meet more students to bring into leadership roles.</p>

            <h1>Designing and shipping initiatives for more pathways in tech</h1>
            <p>Along with our organization's own systems, we've released over a dozen ventures and projects as part of our work to build more pathways in technology. These range from career and mentorship services, entertaining web experiences, and more.</p>
            
                    
            <h3>DevEd</h3>
            <p>Our education initiative is known as <strong>DevEd</strong>, where we produce courseware as well as short bytes of educational information and content. I did design for most DevEd materials and managed the project management and creation of the materials, with our former Technology Head <a href="http://keithleonardo.ml/" target="_blank">Keith Leonardo</a> reviewing and writing a lot of our material. These resources have been shared thousands of times online, used in dozens of classrooms.</p>

                <h2>Insights</h2>
            <h1>Measuring the impact of Developh's work</h1>
                <p>Since founding Developh in 2016, I've been taken to speak across three continents, have talked with  dozens of student teams and learned from hundreds of students about what makes innovation work, and what doesn't. I've shaped my perspective of the tech industry and look at all I do with <strong>intent and empathy shaped by the experiences of over 75,000 students we've touched</strong>. This is the most important work I do today.</p><br>

                </span>
                    
                <p>This organization would not be possible with the work of over 40 core members and volunteers who have helped shaped our work and advocacy. We're constantly aligning our principles with beliefs shaped by all involved and all we try to fight for, plot events and campaigns, and more.</p>
                    
                    
                <p>It's always a challenge to stand up against an ecosystem as teenagers, building new entrypoints to the technology scene out of our own. We knew nothing about networking, startups, technology, design, code, or anything at the beginning of Developh. In four years, I had grown with 40-something passionate friends and volunteers in countless ways. Somehow, this is still only the beginning.</p>
